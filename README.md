# Product Explainer Notes

These are practical notes on how founders can explain complex products clearly.

This repository is focused on:
- Explaining technical or AI products in simple language
- Structuring product narratives for busy founders
- Turning complex workflows into clear product walkthroughs
- Avoiding jargon while preserving technical accuracy

These notes are based on real-world work with early-stage startups
building developer tools, AI products, and SaaS platforms.
